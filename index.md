*LIGO Hanford, Washington, USA*

I am a up-and-coming Honours student at Monash University in Australia. Undertaking research in gravitational-wave astrophysics, I aim to use the novel observational medium of gravitational waves to probe the nature of the Universe and the massive black holes that reside within it. I am a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration in which I contribute significantly to the development of analysis tools to undertake the astrophysical properties of gravitational-wave sources, and to an understanding of gravitational-wave detector calibration.
